This urgent documentary offers a front row seat to life under China's state surveillance system and raises questions about the dangers Big Data poses to individual freedom. Discussion follows. Friday at 7pm (Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrs-71a4ovo) The Chinese government's vision of an all-seeing society is becoming a reality. This eye-opening documentary follows an official  two human rights lawyers' families and a journalist to reveal how a person is gradually integrated into China's state surveillance system. By these haunting stories the film sparks a global debate about the dangers that Big Data and AI pose to individual freedoms. Through intimate v\\u00e9rit\\u00e9 scenes and rich archival footage  filmmaker Jialing Zhang (One Child Nation) aims to explore the changes in social behavior and suppression of human rights when technology is in the hands of unchecked power.

Henson. Saturday at 7pm (Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTnircQsMaM) Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel recounts the abuse and ascendancy of Celie  a poor Black woman living in the rural South in the early 1900s. This revered story was adapted into an Oscar-nominated film and a crowd-pleasing Broadway musical. Here  a bold new take delivers a movie musical with show-stopping set pieces  forays into fantasy and a powerhouse cast: Broadway alums as well as Colman Domingo  Taraji P. Henson and Halle Bailey. Ghanaian filmmaker Blitz Bazawule (The Burial of Kojo) introduces magical realism as an instrument to explore Celie's imagination. Color Purple 2.0 deliberately escapes into sporadic joy with its musical numbers  which allow the viewer to track Celie's emotional journey without being overwhelmed by her horrific traumas. Bazawule explains  \\\"They used humor  laughter  music  imagination and the beauty of the land. Everything we were pulling up to bring levity to this story was already there in Celie's world.\\\" Programmed in conjunction with Black Legacy Month.
